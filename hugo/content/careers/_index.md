## Benefits

We offer a flexible work environment, a competitive benefits package including medical, dental and vision insurance, life insurance, and 401k matching.  The company observes nine paid holidays, provides paid time off for bereavement and jury duty, and offers a generous vacation allowance.

Our headquarters are located in Washington, DC. We have an “IT casual” dress code, enjoy social events, team builders, and a commitment to helping our organization continue to evolve.

The safety and well-being of our team members is of the utmost importance to IdeaCrew.  In response to the health pandemic, our team has been working in a full-time remote as of March 2020.

Since then, we have continued to meet (virtually) for social and team building events including Monthly Fun Meetings, Quarterly Team Events, Happy Hours, Trivia Nights, Game Nights and Cooking with the Crew.  We look forward to being able to return to our modern, open office space, when it is safe to do so.
