In preparation for the American Rescue Plan signed in March, DCHBX and IdeaCrew worked to address how they would develop new features in response to the plan and to support DC Residents with health benefit changes. GCN spoke with CEO, Dan Thomas, and DCHBX Executive Director, Mila Kofman on their recent accomplishments of lowering health insurance premiums for the 100,000 users of DCHBX and expanding the number of people who qualify.

This ground-breaking achievement has allowed for some customers to go from paying $357 for coverage to $3.76 for the same coverage, resulting in $36 million in total savings. This was accomplished through IdeaCrew’s technical expertise and foresight to originally stand up the DCHBX in an agile, cloud-based environment, so when new features are needed they can be implemented cost-effectively and in a short amount of time.
