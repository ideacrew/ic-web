+++
As part of vision to transform service delivery to a whole-person care model, the District of Columbia’s Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) is preparing sweeping improvements to its technology and data management capabilities. Recently, [Stephanie Kanowitz](https://gcn.com/voices/stephanie-kanowitz/18811/?oref=gcn-post-author?oref=rf-post-author) of Government Computer News spoke with Michael Neff, D.C.’s Department of Behavioral Health’s Chief of Administrative Operations and Patrick Canavan, IdeaCrew’s Vice President of Consulting Services who are leading this project. See Ms. Kanowitz’s article: [Health agency looks to data governance to streamline services](https://gcn.com/data-analytics/2022/07/health-agency-looks-data-governance-streamline-services/373179/) to learn how DBH is refitting technology to align with its new mission.

After struggling to work with nearly 70 disparate databases and paper-based grants management, the Washington, D.C.’s Department of Behavioral Health will map its data sources into an integrated technology engine that will ease information sharing and analysis.

Washington, D.C.’s Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) has almost 70 disparate databases and little to no data governance, which complicates its ability to provide prevention, treatment, recovery services and support for about 30,000 district residents with mental health and/or substance use disorders. In May, IdeaCrew announced that DBH had tapped the company to create a proof of concept for redesigning the agency’s use of technology. It will map the various data sources into an integrated technology engine that will allow data to be easily shared and analyzed.
