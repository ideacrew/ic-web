When Maine’s Governor notified CMS that her administration intended to transition  
Maine to a state-based marketplace using the federal platform (SBM-FP) in August  
2019 it signaled Maine's intent to switch to a fully state-run exchange at a later  
date. In fact, state legislation was pushed through and Maine contracted with  
IdeaCrew at the end of January 2021 to provide the marketplace platform (called  
CoverME.gov) to enroll Mainers in coverage ready for open enrollment starting in  
November that year. The challenge: IdeaCrew had only 8 months until October to  
launch. No one had ever transitioned a state from HealthCare.gov that quickly.

IdeaCrew already had a cloud-based marketplace technology platform, successfully  
supporting marketplaces in the District of Columbia since 2015 and Massachusetts  
since 2017. The challenge would be to tailor this platform to provide Mainers with  
the best customer experience, plan choices and lower premiums while seamlessly  
transitioning the 60,000 Mainers with coverage on HealthCare.gov to the new  
platform.

In the first 30 days, IdeaCrew engaged key stakeholders to synthesize plans, key  
milestones and dependencies for launching Maine’s new marketplace later that  
year. In addition to the sponsoring agency, the state’s newly formed Office of the  
Health Insurance Marketplace (OHIM), key stakeholders included;

- State of Maine departments; Office for Family Independence (OFI), Office of  
  Information Technology (OIT), Maine Bureau of Insurance (BOI)
- Federal agencies; Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight  
  (CCIIO), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Internal  
  Revenue Service (IRS)
- Other critical partners: Insurers, Brokers, Navigators and Consumer Health  
  Advocates including Tribes

By August, IdeaCrew received the necessary approvals from CMS to launch the new  
Marketplace, including:

- A single streamlined application providing accurate, real-time eligibility assessments for Medicaid and CHIP, and determinations of advanced premium tax credit eligibility.
